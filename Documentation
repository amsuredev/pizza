I have built a backend application that allows to vote for the best pizza.
The project was implemented with django, django rest framework.
Additionally I add authorisation and authentication.
Authentication is available via tokens.

The project has next apps:
    pizza_project - top level urls; settings
    pizzas - has Model Pizza
    votes - has Model Vote

Database tables(Models):
    Pizza - id;name;price
    Users - built in django
    Votes - author;pizza

By default IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly permission

url structure:
    / - nothing
        api/ - nothing
            pizzas/ -          list of pizzas (GET/POST)
            pizzas/<int:pk>/ - pizza details (DELETE/GET/PUT)   IsAdminUser
            votes/ -           list votes (GET)
            votes/<int:pk> -   list detail (DELETE/GET/PUT)     ReadOnly
            voting_res/ -      list voting results (GET)
            users/ -           list users (GET)
            auth/login/ -      login (POST)
            register/ -        register (POST)
            post_vote/ -       vote (POST)                      IsAuthenticated
